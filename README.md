# Task-CLI
Task CLI is many things, but efficient is not one of those.

After installation, use your compiler of choice to compile Task-CLI, located in the Task-CLI folder.
After compilation, you can directly access the application through the terminal.

Usage:
- To reset or initialize, execute:
`task-cli -init`

- To add a task:
`task-cli -add "name"`

- To remove a task:
`task-cli -pop "name"`

- To list out your tasks:
`task-cli -list`
